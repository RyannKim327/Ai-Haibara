> There are some changes applied to this program. I've added some commands, for you to easily change the preferences of this feature. You may use *cls* or **clear** to clear all the recent messages given by the AI. You may also use **set name as `your name`** to change your name, `your name` must be changed by what name you want to use. You can also modify the text size by executing **set text size to `number`** where number is a digit ranges from 5 to 50. The base size if this font size is based from the name you see on the top. Lastly, there's a feature called **set speech `toggle`** where `toggle` must be either enable or disable. This feature may help you to talk to the AI without typing any text. But you need first to activate the permission from the settings of the app and grant the permission RECORD_AUDIO.
